# noxmox

Node Amazon S3 client and mock-up modules.

This library provides two node.js modules implementing the Amazon S3 REST API functions:

* `nox` - A simple Amazon S3 client supporting the `put()`, `get()` and `del()` methods for an existing bucket.

* `mox` - A simple S3 mock-up, supporting same methods as `nox`, emulating Amazon S3 on a local drive.

# Features

* Very simple to learn and use, get started quickly with Amazon S3.
* Completely interchangeable modules allowing for developing and testing offline, i.e. storing
  files on the local file system, without using the S3 storage space.
* Using node's native api via `http.client`.

# Interface overview

The `nox` and `mox` modules each exports one method called:

* `createClient(options)` - Create client with given options, which is an object containing the AWS key and secret, and the bucket name.

Both `nox` and `mox` clients support the same methods:

* `put(filename, headers={})` - Put file to S3 / local drive.
* `get(filename, headers={})` - Get file from S3 / local drive.
* `delete(filename, headers={})` - Delete file from S3 / local drive.

# Example: walk-trough

The following example is a walk-through of uploading and downloading a file from S3.

Require the `noxmox` module and create an `nox` S3 client:

    var client = require('noxmox').nox.createClient({
      key: '<api-key-here>',
      secret: '<secret-here>',
      bucket: 'mybucket'
    });

Require the file system module and read a file synchronously from disk:

    var data = require('fs').readFileSync('<filename>');
    
Create a request for storing the file in the S3 bucket:

    var req = client.put('<filename>', {'Content-Length': data.length});
    
Listen for the `continue` event emitted by the request, then write the file
data and end the request:

    req.on('continue', function() {
      req.end(data);
    });

To get the acknowledgement and the transaction information from Amazon S3,
listen for the response event and retrieve the response body:

    req.on('response', function(res) {
      res.on('data', function(chunk) {
        console.log(chunk);
      });
      res.on('end', function() {
        if (res.statusCode === 200) {
          console.log('File is now stored on S3');
        }
      });
    });

The file data can be retrieved again with the following code:

    var req = client.get('<filename>');
    req.end();
    req.on('response', function(res) {
      var chunks = [];
      req.on('data', function(chunk) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      });
      req.on('end', function() {
        var data = chunks.join('');
        console.log('Retrieved ' + data.length + ' bytes of file data');
      });
    });

Delete the file from S3:

    var req = client.del('<filename>');
    req.end();
    req.on('response', function(res) {
      res.on('data', function(chunk) {
        console.log(chunk);
      });
      res.on('end', function() {
        if (res.statusCode === 204) {
          console.log('File is now removed from S3');
        }
      });
    });
   
The `nox` and `mox` modules are completly interchangeable, so the above example
can be repeated with `mox` replacing `nox` when creating the client. The file
will then be stored on the local hard drive in the default location `/tmp/mox`.

In a real implementation, the file data should be read and upload asynchronously in chunks, not
synchronously as in this simple example.

## Advanced topics

Make the uploaded file public on S3 by passing the header `'x-amz-acl':'private'` when calling `put()`.

Change the default local storage location for `mox` using the option `prefix:<path>` for specifying the path to store files.

# Acknowledgements

The code to `nox` is partly derived from the [knox](https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox) project, and
in particularly the authentication module (auth.js) is an exact copy of the one from `knox`. These parts

Note: `nox` will unlike `knox` by default keep the uploaded files private, as is also the Amazon S3 default.
